In this work, we have provided an understanding of IRL in the KWIK framework which has not been studied before. Apart from the practical relevance of a KWIK imitation learning algorithm, this setup provides scope for theoretical guarantees that can be provided for active query based IRL which have not been provided so far. We have also laid the groundwork for a new class of algorithms that can be termed as `KWIK classifiers' that will suit tasks similar to IRL-based imitation learning. Since the existing selective sampling based classification approaches do not apply here due to their strong assumptions, an appropriate direction for future work will be to design admissible KWIK classification algorithms that suit our conditions.
