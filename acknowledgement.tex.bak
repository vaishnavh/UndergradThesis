I wish to express my sincere thanks to Prof. Balaraman Ravindran, my research advisor, for his tremendously invaluable and patient guidance throughout the course of this project. The discussions I have had with Prof. Ravindran have been a constant source of encouragement and hope that helped me develop an obsession with the problem and helped me keep exploring for ideas even when all doors seemed to be closed.   

I would also like to offer my special thanks to Aishwarya Padmakumar, (B. Tech Student, CSE IIT Madras) for her support as a friend. 

I am grateful to the members of RLDM, The Multi-disciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making, who provided interesting insights and suggestions with regard to our submission titled \textit{\textbf{â€¢KWIK Inverse Reinforcement Learning}} as part of this work. 

I wish to thank Prof. Csaba Szepesvari,  Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, for his suggestions and views about this work. 

I wish to thank Prof. Michael L. Littman, Department of Computing Science, Brown University, for providing reference to a relevant work.
